Welcome to sqlearn's documentation!
====================================
**sq-learn** is a Python framework integrating quantum routines with classical machine learning algorithms such that we can simulate their quantum counterpart as we were using a fault-tolerant quantum computer.

It aims to provide simple and efficient solutions to learning problems that are accessible to everybody and reusable in various contexts: quantum machine-learning as a versatile tool for science and engineering.

It can be used to run either classical or quantum machine learning experiments.

Up to now only PCA and K-means algorithm can be simulated in their quantum counterpart.
