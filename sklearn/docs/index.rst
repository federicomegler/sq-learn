Welcome to sqlearn's documentation!
====================================
sqlearn is a Python module integrating classical machine
learning algorithms in the tightly-knit world of scientific Python
packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib) with the quantum world.

It aims to provide simple and efficient solutions to learning problems
that are accessible to everybody and reusable in various contexts:
machine-learning as a versatile tool for science and engineering.

It can be used to run either classical experiments or simulation of the quantum counterpart.

Up to now in this framework only PCA and K-means algorithm can be simulated in their quantum counterpart.
See http://scikit-learn.org for complete documentation.
